# Personal Webpage - My very first project using just HTML & CSS!

https://pdl39.github.io/donghunlee-personalweb/index.html

This is a very simple personal webpage made with just HTML & CSS.
It is really simple, but does its job of introducing myself to you!

Page Contents:
- Home
- Profile
- Favorite Quotes
- Favorite Things

To make the pages visually appealing even with just HTML & CSS,
I make use of CSS effects like changes on hover,
and some HTML tweaks to move to different parts on the page on clicking links.

Again, this is a very simple webpage, made as my very first implementation of HTML and CSS.
It was the first step in my journey as a developer.
